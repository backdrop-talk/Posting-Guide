# Posting-Guide
New? Start here: Information about where to post, what to post, how to post and why to post. It's really easy.

## Overview
Backdrop Discussions is a GitHub organization that houses all formal discussion about the growth and direction of Backdrop.

Here you will find policies and guidelines that have been formed by the community over the years and you are welcome to check those out or help build on them.

Discussions are separated by "key topics" as Github Repositories. This allows a clean separation between topics.

## Where to post
Find the repo topic that makes the most sense for the question or concern you have. If you can't find a topic, either use the -General repo topic or choose one that is the closest. Worst case someone may move the discussion to a different repo, best case you picked the right spot. In any case, the -General repo is a catch-all for everything.

## What to post
Post any discussion that is related to the growth and progression of Backdrop as a community and overall project. If you need to bring up a concern with the project code, contrib code or any of the backdrop websites, use the respective organizations and repos for those topics. Everything else that is formal discussion about Backdrops growth goes inside the [https://github.com/backdrop-talk/](https://github.com/backdrop-talk/) organization.

## How to post
Start by posting in the **Discussion** tab unless you have a call-to-action on a physical document that needs to be created or ammended.

The **Issue** tab is for tasks that create or ammend the policies and guidelines within hard documents. These documents can be found in the **Code** tab.

## Why to post
Post because you want to. There are no right or wrong questions and keep in mind this is a community driven project that constantly needs fresh ideas and people who are caring enough to help move it forward.

## Conclusion
Happy posting!
